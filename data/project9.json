This is managed through the LangGraph, which updates itself with each decision, continually evolving the game world.</li><br><li><strong>Unique Jobs and Skills:</strong> Players can assume roles with specific skills or jobs that interact differently with the game environment. For example, a player with a \"scholar\" role might have unique interactions with lore-heavy elements, while a \"warrior\" might alter combat-related storylines.</li></ul>"

This setup facilitates scalability and complex interaction handling.</li><br><li><strong>Data Handling:</strong> Using PostgreSQL for player data management and ChromaDB for handling conversation embeddings, the game ensures efficient data retrieval and storage, supporting a responsive and dynamic game environment.</li></ul>"
